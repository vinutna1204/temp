<b>Full Stack Developer:</b>
    A full-stack developer is a versatile professional who can handle both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development.
    This means they are capable of working on the user interface (front-end) as well as the server-side logic and database management (back-end) of a web application.
<b>Front-End Development</b>
    Front-end development involves creating the visual and interactive elements of a website that users interact with. 
    Full-stack developers use technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and dynamic web pages.
     They may also work with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js to enhance the user experience
<b>Back-End Development</b>
    Back-end development focuses on the server-side logic, database interactions, and application functionality.
     Full-stack developers use programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, and Node.js to build and maintain the server, application, and database.
      They also work with databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL to store and retrieve data.
